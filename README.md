# Trinity-Obfuscator
Server-Side .NET Obfuscator

One of my old softwares from when I was around 16 years old.

Uses sockets to transfer file and dependencies to a server, which then authenticates the user and obfuscates files on the cloud instead of locally, protecting the obfuscation logic.

Developed in C#, authentication written in PHP on the server. Uses a private version of CentosAuth.

Some client-side obfuscation is available free to the user, such as the native packer and string encryptor.

Uses DNLib and modified ConfuserEx. The obfuscator engine in this video is the local free protections, the server-sided engine was sold and isn't mine to release anymore.

Developed this project around 2018/2019.

This hasn't been optimised, and it hasn't been made to contributions on GitHub, I am just uploading old projects online that I found on my old computers.
