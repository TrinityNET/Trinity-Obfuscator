# Trinity-Obfuscator
Server-Side .NET Obfuscator

One of my old softwares from when I was around 15 years old.

Uses sockets to transfer file and dependencies to a server, which then authenticates the user and obfuscates files on the cloud instead of locally, protecting the obfuscation logic.

Developed in C#, authentication written in PHP on the server. Uses a private version of CentosAuth.

Some client-side obfuscation is available free to the user, such as the native packer and string encryptor.

Uses DNLib and modified ConfuserEx.
